### ABOUT
This app was built to help people increase their math fluency in three areas: adding, subtracting, and multiplying. Users can choose their topic of study and the time they would like to spend practicing. During the round, users will answer questions. If the answer is correct, a new card will appear. If the answer is incorrect, the user can change their answer. After the round is played, users will see their stats.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project has a robust testing suite using Jest.
